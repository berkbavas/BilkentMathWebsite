                <li>Applications are made to the Registrar's Office by the due date announced in the Academic Calendar

                    the Spring semester).</li>
                <li>Student quotas for the second-major programs are determined by the Rectorate

                    major.</li>
                <li>Students in the program must complete all courses in the Mathematics curriculum either by taking the
                    course, or having the course common with their first major, or by having the course deemed
                    equivalent
                    with a course in their first major. Full course requirements are listed in the curriculum link
