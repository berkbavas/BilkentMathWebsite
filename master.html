                be an exploration in some
                depth
                of a particular area of mathematics, or it may be an extension/completion of a higher level of education
                than achieved in undergraduate studies. To be effective, it must serve the purpose of deepening the
                students' experience in some particular area of knowledge, and making them professionally more
                competent.
                Students should show a sense of commitment and confidence appropriate to their status as a
                mathematician.
                With the satisfactions inherent in this experience they will necessarily follow a greater experience of
                initiative and more positive assumption of individual responsibility in their work.</p>

                applicants is based on their ALES scores, past academic record and the interview at Bilkent University.
