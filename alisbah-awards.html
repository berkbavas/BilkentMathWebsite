                <h1>Orhan Alisbah Awards</h1>
                <p> Orhan Alisbah Mathematics Awards are conferred in memory
                    of <strong><a href="#orhan-alisbah">Orhan Alisbah
                    (1910--1989)</a></strong>, one of the earliest and best-known
                    mathematicians of the Republic of Turkey. Initiated
                    in 1998 by <strong><a href="#bilsel-alisbah">Bilsel Alisbah</a></strong>, 
                    son of Orhan Alisbah, and
                    later continued by the generous contributions

                    support each year to the most successful
                    graduate student and the most successful undergraduate
                    student of the Mathematics Department. This
                    fellowship ensures that the memory of Orhan Alisbah
                    lives on, continuing to serve as an exemplary
                    role model for young mathematicians.</p>

                    <p class="two-column">One of modern Turkey's early and leading mathematicians, he was born in İstanbul in 1910. He
                        never really
                        got to know his father, a "Young Turk" who died in exile. Consequently Orhan and his younger
                        brother and
                        sister were raised by their mother in the family home in Üsküdar.
                        He graduated from the İstanbul Boy's High School in 1929. Upon graduation, he won a State
                        scholarship,
                        and was sent to Germany for his university studies. He received his doctorate from the
                        University of
                        Berlin in 1935.</p>

                    <p>In a teaching career that spanned forty years, Professor Alisbah taught in major institutions of
                        education both in Turkey and in the United States. Between 1936 and 1943 he was an assistant
                        professor
                        at İstanbul University. During this period he also taught at the İstanbul Technical University.
                        In 1943
                        he came as professor to the Science Faculty of Ankara University, where he was also the Chairman
                        of the
                        Math Department until 1955.</p>

                    <p>In 1955, in recognition of his stature and work, he was invited for a year to the Institute for
                        Advanced
                        Studies in Princeton, New Jersey which at that time was the research home of professors Einstein
                        and
                        Oppenheimer, among others. This launched the US phase of his career. He was a Visiting Professor
                        at the
                        University of Pennsylvania 1956-*1960. During this period he also taught some courses at
                        Swarthmore
                        College and at Rutgers University.</p>

                    <p>Professor Alisbah completed his career at Rutgers University in New Jersey, with which he was
                        associated
                        from 1959 until his retirement in 1977. During his last seven years there he served as the
                        Chairman of
                        the Department of Pure & Applied Mathematics on the Camden Campus. During his years at Rutgers,
                        he also
                        returned twice to Turkey to teach as Visiting Professor (1966/67 at METU) and (1970/71 at METU
                        and
                        Hacettepe University).</p>

                    <p>Professor Alisbah loved teaching, and like all good teachers reveled in the development and
                        success of
                        his students. He also saw his role towards his students and the university not just as a teacher
                        of math
                        but as a developer of good and decent human beings. This was consistent with his approach to his
                        own
                        life. Throughout it, he considered himself a citizen of the world with an obligation to help
                        make the
                        world a better place. To this end he was active in the Human Rights Commission and the UNESCO
                        Committee
                        in Turkey, and always participated fully in community events and activities wherever he lived.

                    <p>Bilsel Alisbah, the son of Orhan Alisbah, and Albert Einstein at the Princeton Institute of
                        Advanced Studies. At that time the institute had a station wagon car for transportation to
                        the
                        city. Two people always insisted sitting on the front, Bilsel and Albert. Thus they met and
                        became friends. The picture is taken in August 1953 and signed by Einstein in 1954.</p>
