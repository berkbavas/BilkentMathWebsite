                    <!-- HISTORY TEXT -->
                    <p>
                        In 1986, when Bilkent University admitted its first students, the
                        mathematics department was positioned as a unit within the Faculty
                        of Engineering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the end of 1989, it was officially decided to reposition the
                        Mathematics Department as an independent department to conduct
                        high-level research on an international scale.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Initially, only the graduate program was launched. The first
                        undergraduate students joined the department in 1991.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The mission of the department has been to provide a solid
                        undergraduate foundation for students who plan to pursue graduate
                        or doctoral studies in applied or pure mathematics, while also
                        supporting internationally recognized research.
                    </p>
