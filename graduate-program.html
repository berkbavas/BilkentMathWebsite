            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Graduate Program of the Department of Mathematics at Bilkent University is among the leading
                mathematics research programs in Turkey. The normal duration of the program is two years for the M.S.
                degree and four years for the Ph.D. degree.</p>

            <p>The M.S. and Ph.D. programs produce leading research mathematicians. Throughout both programs, there is
                a strong emphasis on supervised research towards a thesis. To provide a solid foundation for subsequent
                professional work, each program includes 7 courses based on lectures to small elite classes. </p>
